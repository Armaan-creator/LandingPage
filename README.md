# Welcome to Cascading Coder's Landing Page
## ![Cascading Coder's logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19316487/66330366-40528d80-e8fe-11e9-9375-4ddb13d3b983.jpg) 
### The goal is to get experience with Open Source and have fun with React while creating a fun and interactive page that will launch live with the cascadingcoders.com domain for Hacktoberfest! 


#### üìè The finer details....

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`
- This will install dependencies, and important to do  as we update master


### `npm start`
- _Runs the app in the development mode.<br />_
_Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser._

- _The page will reload if you make edits.<br />_
	_You will also see any lint errors in the console._

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### üìã Contributing Guidelines

- Create separate components in their own files inside `/components` -  where it makes sense
- Create separate .css stylesheets and import them in their components
- When creating branches - be specific and use camelCase (components should always have first letter capitalized) : ex) `fixHeaderNav` or `HeaderNavFix` would be acceptable, with `Header` being a component
- Do comment
- Have fun - and use as much React as possible!

### üé® Style Guidelines
